The algorithms used in LTL3DRA are described in:
  T. Babiak, F. Blahoudek, M. Kretinsky, and J. Strejcek
  "Effective Translation of LTL to Deterministic Rabin Automata:
     Beyond the (F,G)-Fragment (2013)"
  In 11th International Symposium on Automated Technology 
    for Verification and Analysis (ATVA 2013)

The LTL3BA software was written by Tomas Babiak and the algorithms are
  described in:
  T. Babiak, M. Kretinsky, F. Rehak, and J. Strejcek
  "LTL to Buchi Automata Translation: Fast and More Deterministic"
  In 18th International Conference on Tools and Algorithms for the
  Construction and Analysis of Systems (TACAS 2012)

The LTL2BA software was written by Denis Oddoux and modified by Paul
Gastin.  It is based on the translation algorithm presented at CAV '01:

Part of the code included is issued from the SPIN software Version 3.4.1
The SPIN software is written by Gerard J. Holzmann, originally as part
of ``Design and Validation of Protocols,'' ISBN 0-13-539925-4,
1991, Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 07632
Here are the files that contain some code from Spin v3.4.1 :

  cache.c  (originally tl_cache.c)
  lex.c    (           tl_lex.c  )
  ltl2ba.h (           tl.h      )
  main.c   (           tl_main.c )
  mem.c    (           tl_mem.c  )
  parse.c  (           tl_parse.c)
  rewrt.c  (           tl_rewrt.c)
  trans.c  (           tl_trans.c)

2. REQUIREMENTS

LTL3DRA needs BuDDy (Binary Decision Diagram) library.
BuDDy is available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/buddy/
LTL3DRA was tested with BuDDy version 2.4

3. COMPILING

open the archive :
> gunzip ltl3dra-0.1.tar.gz
> tar xf ltl3dra-0.1.tar
> cd ltl3dra-0.1

Edit Makefile and set paths to BuDDy's files "bdd.h" and "libbdd.a".
(Edit BUDDY_INCLUDE and BUDDY_LIB)

compile the program
> make

3. EXECUTING

run the program
> ./ltl3dra -f "formula"

The formula is an LTL formula, and may contain propositional symbols, 
boolean operators, temporal operators, and parentheses.
The syntax used is the one used in the 'Spin' model-checker

Propositonal Symbols:
        true, false
        any lowercase string

Boolean operators:
        !   (negation)
        ->  (implication)
        <-> (equivalence)
        &&  (and)
        ||  (or)

Temporal operators:
        F []  (always)
        G <>  (eventually)
        U     (until)
        R V   (release)
        X     (next)

Use spaces between any symbols.

The result is a TGDRA in the HOA format v1.

To produce a DRA in ltl2dstar format v2 run
> ./ltl3dra -L -f "formula"

run the command
> ./ltl3dra
to see the possible options for executing the program
